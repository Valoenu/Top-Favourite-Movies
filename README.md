This project is a Flask-based web application built as part of my learning journey through the Udemy App Brewery Python Bootcamp. It allows users to search for movies via The Movie Database (TMDb) API, add them to a personal collection, and rate or review them. I used Flask, SQLAlchemy, WTForms, and Bootstrap to create a full-stack CRUD app. This project helped me solidify my understanding of RESTful APIs, database management, and Python web development fundamentals.
